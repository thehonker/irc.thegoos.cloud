#  If you want to link servers to InspIRCd you must load the          #
#  spanningtree module! Please see the modules list for               #
#  information on how to load this module! If you do not load this    #
#  module, server ports will NOT work!                                #

# Listener that binds on a TCP/IP endpoint:
<bind
      # address: IP address to bind to if the box that you are hosting
      # on has more than one IP, else the ircd will try to bind to all
      # IP's on the box if this is not defined.

      # you can select multiple ports by separating them
      # with a - character like the example below.

      # type: Type of bind block this is. It can either be clients or
      # servers. Whichever you select will be the only type able to connect

      # the name of a custom <sslprofile> tag that you have defined or one
      # of "openssl", "gnutls", "mbedtls" if you have not defined any. See the
      # docs page for the TLS (SSL) module you are using for more details.

#   "mbedtls" (requires the ssl_mbedtls module)

# When linking servers, the OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and mbedTLS implementations are
# completely link-compatible and can be used alongside each other on each end
# of the link without any significant issues.
