# This optional tag allows you to specify how wide a G-line, E-line,  #
# K-line, Z-line or Q-line can be before it is forbidden from being   #
# set. By setting hostmasks="yes", you can allow all G-, K-, E-lines, #
# no matter how many users the ban would cover. This is not           #
# recommended! By setting ipmasks="yes", you can allow all Z-lines,   #
# no matter how many users these cover too. Needless to say we        #
# don't recommend you do this, or, set nickmasks="yes", which will    #
# allow any Q-line.                                                   #
